# Super-hero CSS

For this lab you're going to modify the starter code to style the content with basic CSS styles to look like the final screen captures below.

### Selecting Colors

If you don't already have the Chrome Extension [ColorZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en) installed, you can get it here. It will allow you to use the eyedropper tool to select any web page content and it will give you the color code to use in your stylesheet. Use the eyedropper tool to select the colors from the after screen captures below to get a good match to use in your version.

### Make the following style changes

* set the font-family for the entire web page to "Poppins" as first choice and san-serif as fallback. Poppins is a google font. See the link in the Resources section for directions.
* for all of the sections
  * set a padding of 20px around the content
  * set a margin of 60px on the bottom so there is space between sections
* first section
  * set the background color to a shade of red close to his costume 
  * set the text color to white
  * set the color of the list item text to black and the font weight to a darker shade than default.
* second section
  * set the background color to a shade of blue close to his costume.
  * set the text color to white
  * set the hover color for the anchor to black
* third section
  * set the background color to a shade of grey close to his costume
  * set the font-family to use "Georgia" as the first choice
* image
  * set the width to 100% so that it will be sized to the size of its container
  * create a solid black border 2px wide around each image
